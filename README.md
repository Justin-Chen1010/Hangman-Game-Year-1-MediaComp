# Hangman Game Year 1 Media Computation

**Version 1.0.0**

This program is a minigame coded in Python, it's a simple hangman game that I made in first year semester 1 when I first started out coding. It takes a list of countries from the textfile and randomly picks one. You are first prompted to guess a letter and if you guessed one of the correct ones it will output the up to date guessing word in a hangman format.

Example: " A _ S T _ A L \_ A", you have x attempts left.
